On some Unix machines, the default FindBoost.cmake file fails to correctly
identify the boost libraries installed on the system (libboost_*). One 
possible reason for this is the failure map the existing libraries due to 
a buggy REGEX expression.

Included is a FindBoost.cmake file that helps address this specific problem. 
The differences from the original FindBoost.cmake are: 
   Original Line 360 : 
     STRING(REGEX REPLACE ".* ([0-9])\\.([0-9])\\.[0-9] .*" "\\1\\2"

   Fixed Line 360:
     STRING(REGEX REPLACE ".*\\(GCC\\) ([0-9])\\.([0-9])\\.[0-9].*" "\\1\\2"

This file should be used automatically by HPX's build system (instead of the 
default one). If you experience problems please either edit the above Line in 
your FindBoost.cmake files. Alternatively a corrected FindBoost.cmake file 
has been provided in hpx/misc for your convenience. 

FindBoost.cmake is usually found in :
 <CMake_install_path>/share/cmake-2.6/Modules/


Thanks to RaviTej, CMake Mailing lists, BOOST-CMake Mailing Lists for 
their support in identification and resolution of this problem.
