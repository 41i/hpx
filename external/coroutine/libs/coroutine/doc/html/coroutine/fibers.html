        Introduction
      </h3>
<p>
        This section will shortly describe the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Win32</span>
        <span class="identifier">fibers</span></tt> facility, compare them to
        the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span> <span class="identifier">makecontext</span><span class="special">/</span><span class="identifier">swapcontext</span>
        <span class="identifier">API</span></tt> and finally show how Boost.Coroutine
        can be implemented in term of fibers.
      </p>
<div class="sidebar"><p>
        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/caution.png" alt="caution"></span> <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span></tt>
        compliance does not guarantee the presence of the context <tt class="literal">API</tt>,
        as this is an optional feature. It is required by the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Single</span>
        <span class="identifier">Unix</span> <span class="identifier">Specification</span></tt>,
        also known as <tt class="literal">X/Open System Interface</tt>.
      </p></div>
<a name="fibers.the_apis"></a><h3>
<a name="id706580"></a>
        The APIs
      </h3>
<p>
        The <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fiber</span> <span class="identifier">API</span></tt>
        in practice implements pure symmetric coroutines. While argument passing
        from coroutine to coroutine is not explicitly supported, it can be implemented
        easily on top of the existing facilities.
      </p>
<p>
        The <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">makecontext</span><span class="special">/</span><span class="identifier">swapcontext</span> <span class="identifier">API</span></tt>
        is extremely similar as it supports argument-less symmetric coroutine switching.
      </p>
<p>
        The <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">SwitchToFiber</span></tt> function
        is used to yield from the current fiber to a new one. Notice that it requires
        that a fiber is already running. The current context is saved in the current
        fiber.
      </p>
<div class="sidebar"><p>
        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/note.png" alt="note"></span> <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Win32</span></tt>
        also provides <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">SwitchToFiberEx</span></tt>
        that can optionally save the floating point context. The Microsoft documentation
        warns that if the appropriate flag is not set the floating point context
        may not be saved and restored correctly. In practice this seems not to be
        needed because the calling conventions on this platform requires the floating
        point register stack to be empty before calling any function, <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">SwitchToFiber</span></tt> included. The exception is
        that if the floating point control word is modified, other fibers will see
        the new floating point status. This should be expected thought, because the
        control word should be treated as any other shared state. Currently Boost.Coroutine
        does not set the "save floating point" flag (saving the floating
        point control word is a very expensive operation), but seems to work fine
        anyway. To complicate the matter more, recent <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Win32</span></tt>
        documentation reveal that the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">FIBER_FLAG_FLOAT_SWITCH</span></tt>
        flag is no longer supported since Windows XP and Windows 2000 SP4.
      </p></div>
<p>
        The corresponding function in the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span></tt>
        standard is <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">swapcontext</span></tt> that
        saves the current context in a memory area pointed by the first argument
        and restores the context pointed by the second argument. This function is
        more flexible than <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">SwitchToFiber</span></tt>
        because it has no concept of current fiber. Unfortunately it is also deeply
        flawed because the standard requires requires the signal mask to be saved
        and restored. This in turn requires a function call. Because of this, at
        least on Linux, <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">swapcontext</span></tt>
        is about a thousand times slower than an hand rolled context switch. <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">SwitchToFiber</span></tt> has no such a problem and
        is close to optimal.
      </p>
<p>
        The <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fiber</span> <span class="identifier">API</span></tt>
        requires a context to be created with a call to <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">CreateFiber</span></tt>.
        The stack size, the address of the function that will be run on the new fiber,
        and a void pointer to pass to this function must be provided. This function
        is simple to use but the user cannot provide its own stack pointer (useful
        if a custom allocator is used). The function will return a pointer to the
        initialized fiber.
      </p>
<p>
        <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span></tt> has <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">makecontext</span></tt>,
        that takes as parameter a context previously initialized, a function pointer
        to bind to the context and a void pointer to be passed to the function. The
        function is a bit more awkward to use because the context to be initialized
        by a call to <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">getcontext</span></tt> and
        some fields (specifically the stack pointer and stack size) to be manually
        initialized. On the other hand the user can specify the area that will be
        used as a stack.
      </p>
<p>
        The <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fiber</span> <span class="identifier">API</span></tt>
        provides a <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">DeleteFiber</span></tt> function
        that must be called to delete a fiber. <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span></tt>
        has no such facility, because contexts are not internally heap allocated
        and require no special cleanup. The user is responsible of freeing the stack
        area when no longer necessary.
      </p>
<a name="convert_thread_to_fiber"></a><p>
      </p>
<p>
        A quirk of the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fiber</span> <span class="identifier">API</span></tt>
        is the requirement that the current thread be converted to fiber before calling
        <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">SwitchToFiber</span></tt>. (<tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span></tt> doesn't require this because <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">swapcontext</span></tt> will initialize automatically
        the context that it is saving to). A thread is converted with a call to
        <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">ConvertThreadToFiber</span></tt>. When
        the fiber is not longer needed a call to <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">ConvertFiberToThread</span></tt>
        must be performed (It is not required that the fiber to be converted to thread
        was the original one) or fibrous resources are leaked. Calling <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">ConvertThreadToFiber</span></tt>more than once will
        also leak resources. Unfortunately the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Win32</span></tt>
        does not include a function to detect if a thread has been already converted.
        This makes hard for different libraries to cooperate. In practice it is possible,
        although undocumented, to detect if a thread has been converted, and Boost.Coroutine
        does so. <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Longhorn</span></tt> will provide
        an <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">IsFiber</span></tt> function that
        can be used for this purpose.
      </p>
<div class="sidebar"><p>
        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/note.png" alt="note"></span> For the sake of information we document here how <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">IsFiber</span></tt> can be implemented. If a thread
        has not been converted, <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">GetCurrentFiber</span></tt>
        will return null on some systems (this appears to be the case on <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Windows95</span></tt> derived OSs), or 0x1E00 on others
        (this appears to be the case on NT derived systems; after a thread has been
        converted and reconverted it may then return null). What the magic number
        0x1E00 means can only be guessed, it is probably related to the alternate
        meaning of the fiber pointer field in the Thread Identification Block. This
        field in fact is also marked as <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">TIB</span>
        <span class="identifier">Verion</span></tt>. What version is meant is
        not documented. This is probably related to compatibility to the common ancestor
        of <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">NT</span></tt> and <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">OS</span><span class="special">/</span><span class="number">2</span></tt> where this
        field is also identified with this name. While this magic number is not guaranteed
        to stay fixed in future system (although unlikely to change as the OS vendor
        is very concerned about backward compatibility), this is not a problem as
        future <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Win32</span></tt> OSs will have
        a native <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">IsFiber</span></tt> functions.

        The environments
      </h3>
<p>
        <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Win32</span></tt> explicitly guarantees
        that contexts will be swapped correctly with fibers, especially exception
        handlers. Exceptions, in the form of Structured Exception Handling, are a
        documented area of the operating system, and in practice most programming
        language on this environment use <span class="bold"><b>SEH</b></span> for
        exception handling. Fibers guarantee that exceptions will work correctly.
      </p>
<p>
        The <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span> <span class="identifier">API</span></tt>
        has no concept of exceptions, thus there is no guarantee that they are automatically
        handled by <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">makecontext</span><span class="special">/</span><span class="identifier">swapcontext</span> </tt> (and in fact on many systems
        they not work correctly). In practice systems that use fame unwind tables
        for exception handling (the so-called no overhead exception handling) should
        be safe, while systems that use a <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">setjmp</span><span class="special">/</span><span class="identifier">longjmp</span></tt>
        based system will not without some compiler specific help.
      </p>
<p>
        <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Win32</span></tt> guarantees that a
        <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fiber</span></tt> can be saved in one
        thread and restored on another, as long as fiber local storage is used instead
        of thread local storage. Unfortunately most third party libraries use only
        thread local storage. The standard C library should be safe though.
      </p>
<p>
        <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span></tt> does not specify the
        behavior of contexts in conjunction with threads, and in practice complier
        optimizations often prevent contexts to be migrated between threads.
      </p>
<a name="fibers.the_implementation"></a><h3>
<a name="id707098"></a>
        The implementation
      </h3>
<p>
        Boost.Coroutine can be straightforwardly implemented with the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">makecontext</span><span class="special">/</span><span class="identifier">swapcontext</span> <span class="identifier">API</span></tt>.
        These functions can be directly mapped to <tt class="computeroutput"><a href="../">yield_to</a><span class="special">()</span></tt>, while a transformation similar to the
        one described <a href="symmetric_coroutines.html#symmetric_transformation">here</a> is used
        to implement asymmetric functionality.
      </p>
<p>
        It is more interesting to analyze the implementation of Boost.Coroutine on
        top <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fibers</span></tt>.
      </p>
<p>
        When a coroutine is created a new <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fiber</span></tt>
        is associated with it. This fiber is deleted when the coroutine is destroyed.
        Yielding form coroutine to coroutine is done straight forwardly using <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">SwitchToFiber</span></tt>.
      </p>
<a name="convert_thread_to_fiber_optimization"></a><p>
      </p>
<p>
        Switching from the main context to a coroutine is a bit more involved. Boost.Coroutine
        does not require the main context to be a coroutine, thus <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">ConvertThreadToFiber</span></tt>is
        only called lazily when a coroutine call need to be performed and <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">ConvertFiberToThread</span></tt> is called immediately
        after the coroutine yields to the main context. This implies a huge performance
        penalty, but correctness has been preferred above performance. If the thread
        has been already converted by the user, the calls to the two functions above
        are skipped and there is no penalty. Thus performance sensitive programs
        should always call <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">ConvertThreadToFiber</span></tt>
        explicitly for every thread that may use coroutines.
      </p>
<a name="fibers.conclusions"></a><h3>
<a name="id707208"></a>
        Conclusions
      </h3>
<p>
        Of the two <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">APIs</span></tt>, the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span></tt> one is simpler to use and more flexible
        from a programmer point of view, but in practice it is not very useful because
        it is often very slow and there are no guarantees that it will work correctly
        on all circumstances.
      </p>
<p>
        On the other hand the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fiber</span> <span class="identifier">API</span></tt> is a bit more complex, and matches
        less with the spirit of Boost.Coroutine, but the detailed description of
        the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">API</span></tt>, the guarantee that
        the operating system supports it and the support for migration, make it the
        most solid implementation of coroutines available.
      </p>
<p>
        Finally, while <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">makecontext</span></tt>
        and family are considered obsolescent since the last <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span></tt>
        edition, the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fiber</span> <span class="identifier">API</span></tt>
        is here to stay, especially because it seems that the new <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="special">.</span><span class="identifier">NET</span></tt> environment makes use of it.
