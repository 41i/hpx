        A simple trick, the Duff device
      </h3>
<p>
        It is possible to implement a very restricted set of coroutine functionality
        entirely within the language rules, using a variation of the duff device.
        See for example<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html" target="_top">Coroutines
        in C</a>. While this is a cunning hack, it has some severe limitations
        that makes it unsuitable for a general purpose library like Boost.Coroutine:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
          Does only support <span class="emphasis"><em>semi</em></span>-coroutines: cannot yield form
          inside nested functions.
        </li>
<li>
          There can only be one instance of a coroutine for each coroutine body.
        </li>
<li>
          Local variables are static. This means that they are not destroyed when
          exceptions are thrown. In general the use of statics as locals is questionable.

<a name="implementation.the_stack_switching_model"></a><h3>
<a name="id706012"></a>
        The stack switching model
      </h3>
<p>
        Boost.Coroutine is implemented around a stack switching model; that is, every
        time a coroutine is entered, the following actions are carried:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
          The caller instruction pointer and callee clobbered registers are saved
          on the caller stack (this is done automatically as part of the call to
          the context switching routine respectively by the compiler and by the CPU).
        </li>
<li>
          the set of callee save registers are saved by the context switching routine
          on the caller stack.
        </li>
<li>
          The caller stack pointer is saved inside the caller context structure.
          This structure is stored on the coroutine context if a yield_to or yield
          is being performed, else it is also on the caller stack.
        </li>
<li>
          The callee stack pointer is retrieved from the callee context structure
          and set as current stack pointer.
        </li>
<li>
          Callee save registers are popped from the callee stack.
        </li>
<li>
          The context switching routine returns, restoring automatically from the
          new stack the called coroutine instruction pointer and clobbered registers.
        </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
        This process is inherently non portable, requires intimate knowledge of the
        target CPU and environment, and some assembly code. Also it assumes the existence
        of both a stack and a real CPU, neither of witch are required by the standard.
      </p>
<p>
        In practice the library should be portable to most platforms that have a
        <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">C</span><span class="special">++</span></tt>
        implementation, with only minimal changes. CPUs with registers windows shouldn't
        be a problem, nor should be systems with multiple stack. For example HP provides
        assembler source for coroutine stack switching for the Itanium architecture,
        that has both registers windows and multiple stacks <a href="bibliography.html#itanium-coroutines">[Saboff03]</a>.
      </p>
<p>
        Implementing Boost.Coroutine on an <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">C</span><span class="special">++</span></tt> interpreter would require support form
        the interpreter.
      </p>
<p>
        If all else fail, there is still the possibility of implementing Boost.Coroutine
        in top of threads, albeit at a very high performance penalty.

<a name="implementation.the_myth_of_a_portable_coroutine_library"></a><h3>
<a name="id706090"></a>
        The myth of a portable coroutine library
      </h3>
<p>
        Writing a portable coroutine library has been the subject of numerous studies.
        A part from the limited <a href="implementation.html#duff_device">Duff device-based trick</a>,
        the most promising has been the stack copying model. The lower and highest
        addresses of the current stack are calculated by taking the address of appropriately
        placed local objects. Then, when the stack switching is required, the current
        stack is copied to some backup location and from another location a target
        stack is copied in place of the old stack. The actual context switch is performed
        using <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">setjmp</span></tt> and <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">longjmp</span></tt>. As an optimization, the address
        of the stack pointer is found, in a non portable manner, in the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">jmp_buf</span></tt> and the stack is switched by modifying
        this pointer instead of performing an expensive copy.
      </p>
<p>
        This trick has meet a moderate success in the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">C</span></tt>
        world, even if in practice libraries using this trick need to take special
        per-platform actions (like working around standard libraries bugs, eager
        optimizers or simply identifying the position of the stack pointer in <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">jmp_buf</span></tt>). Notice that nowhere the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">C</span></tt> standard guarantees that the stack can
        be switched with impunity. In fact, it doesn't even guarantees that a stack
        exists at all (so does the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">C</span><span class="special">++</span></tt> standard).
      </p>
<p>
        In the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">C</span><span class="special">++</span></tt>
        world things are complicated by the fact that the standard permits an implementation
        of <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">longjmp</span></tt> to unwind the
        stack and call destructors. Usually the compiler determines how much to unwind
        the stack by comparing stack pointers. Modifying this pointer will wreak
        havoc. While most implementations do not take advantage of this possibilities,
        at least the <a href="http://www.codesourcery.com/cxx-abi/abi.html" target="_top">OpenMP</a>
        (that by no mean is restricted to this platform: for example is supported
        by the GCC compiler on most platforms it runs on) requires that. Also the
        <a href="http:/www.llvm.org" target="_top"><span class="underline">_LLVM</span>_</a>
        compiler provides a <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">__builtin_longjmp</span></tt>
        builtin that is documented to unwind the stack (even if a standard library
        is not required to implement <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">longjmp</span></tt>
        in term of this builtin, it is likely to do so).
      </p>
<p>
        Also some compilers and some operating systems requires some work to switch
        exceptions context. This is true at least on <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Win32</span></tt>
        and on GCC <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">setjmp</span><span class="special">/</span><span class="identifier">longjmp</span></tt> based exception handling. This
        is very system specific and a library that doesn't take this into account
        is likely to be defective.
      </p>
<p>
        Finally the interaction between coroutines and threads must be taken into
        account and any incompatibilities must be documented or fixed.
      </p>
<p>
        In conclusion, the backend of a <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">C</span><span class="special">++</span></tt> coroutine library cannot be oblivious of
        the system it runs on, thus it might as well be system specific. Similar
        platforms common code may still be shared.
      </p>
<p>
        Currently the library uses <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fibers</span></tt>
        on <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Win32</span></tt> systems, custom
        assembler code on the very specific "GCC-linux-x86 using frame-unwind-tables
        based exception handling and a generic <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">makecontext</span><span class="special">/</span><span class="identifier">setcontext</span></tt>
        based implementation on <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span> <span class="number">2001</span></tt> compliant systems. Note that, as the
        <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span></tt> standard knows nothing
        about <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">C</span><span class="special">++</span></tt>,
        this is not guaranteed to work on all platforms. Also the interaction between
        threads and user contexts is not specified by the standard.
      </p>
<a name="implementation.extensibility"></a><h3>
<a name="id706320"></a>
        Extensibility
      </h3>
<p>
        The library has been designed to be very easily ported to other environments.
        All classes that need access to the non portable context switching code have
        a (currently undocumented) extra template parameter that permit the selection
        of the context switching implementation at compile time. Thus is technically
        possible to mix different context implementations in the same library.
      </p>
<p>
        The context switching support is very simple and tightly contained. It only
        requires a context structure and two function for context setup and context
        swap (the interface is modeled around the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">POSIX</span>
        <span class="identifier">makecontext</span> <span class="identifier">API</span></tt>).
        At this time the actual extension interface is not documented and a private
        detail, because it is likely to be further simplified (the current requirements
        of the <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Context</span></tt> concept have
        been complicated to explore potential performance optimizations).
      </p>
<a name="implementation.a_wild_dream__compiler_support_for_coroutines"></a><h3>
<a name="id706364"></a>
        A wild dream: Compiler support for coroutines
      </h3>
<p>
        The stack switching model, while good enough for generalized cooperative
        multitasking, prevents some useful compiler optimizations. For example a
        compiler cannot optimize across a coroutine call, nor can inline the coroutine
        in the caller. This is expected in when the target is not statically known,
        for example in an event dispatching loop, but in usages where the control
        flow can be statically determined is a loss. For example generators function
        objects can usually be inlined while coroutine based function objects cannot.
      </p>
<p>
        A compiler that knows about coroutines could apply the same optimizations
        to coroutine based code, as long as a context switch target is known. This
        should not require much more power than the ability to inline function pointers
        and convert a coroutine body to callback based code. Even dynamic coroutine
        code could be rewritten it to callback based code, but in this case an indirect
        jump is required anyways and is not necessarily a win.
      </p>
<p>
        Compilers capable of inlining coroutines already exist. For example, compilers
        for languages with support for continuations often transform the code to
        be complied in the so called continuation passing style. Coroutines in these
        languages can be trivially implemented as continuations. These compilers
        can then optimize the code in <span class="bold"><b>CPS</b></span> form,
        potentially inlining some continuation calls. Thus potentially coroutines
        are optimized too.
      </p>
<p>
        Unfortunately the <span class="bold"><b>CPS</b></span> form is not suitable
        for <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">C</span></tt> and <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">C</span><span class="special">++</span></tt> because it does not match well the execution
        model of these languages and even if possible it could impose some overhead.
      </p>
<p>
        The <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">C</span># <span class="number">2.0</span></tt>
        language requires compilers to be capable of transforming <span class="emphasis"><em>semi</em></span>-coroutine
        based code to callback based code. These compilers are not much different
        from <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">C</span><span class="special">++</span></tt>
        compilers. While the limitation to optimize <span class="emphasis"><em>semi</em></span>-coroutine
        can seem major, in practice a coroutine can be converted to a <span class="emphasis"><em>semi</em></span>-coroutine
        if all nested functions that call <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">yield</span></tt>
        can be inlined in the coroutine itself. A compiler could fall back on stack
        switching if it cannot inline a <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">yield</span></tt>
        (or it doesn't know at all if a function can yield).
