    /// abstract data type (an entity grouping several variables that may or 
    /// may not be numerical) which constitutes the classic method for 
    /// restricting access to shared resources, such as shared memory, in a 
    /// multiprogramming environment. Semaphores exist in many variants, though 
    /// usually the term refers to a counting semaphore, since a binary 
    /// semaphore is better known as a mutex. A counting semaphore is a counter 
    /// for a set of available resources, rather than a locked/unlocked flag of 
    /// a single resource. It was invented by Edsger Dijkstra. Semaphores are 
    /// the classic solution to preventing race conditions in the dining 
    /// philosophers problem, although they do not prevent resource deadlocks.
    /// 
    /// Counting semaphores can be used for synchronizing multiple threads as 
    /// well: one thread waiting for several other threads to touch (signal) 
    /// the semaphore, or several threads waiting for one other thread to touch 
    /// this semaphore.
