Known Issues
************
On some Unix Systems, CMake 2.6 fails to locate the installed BOOST 
library instance. One of the known issues that causes the failure to locate 
the libraries is due to regular expression issues in FindBoost.cmake module of 
the default CMake install. 

In HPX_ROOT/misc/ please find a modified FindBoost.cmake that helps resolve this 
problem and a description on how install the module.
