Overview:

These are HPX logfile processing scripts. Please add any functionality that you think would make reading the log files easier.

hpx_log.py:

This script defines two classes for reading in and parsing through a logfile. An HpxLog contains a number of HpxLogEvent's, corresponding to the lines in the logfile. An HpxLogEvent contains a number of fields, corresponding to the columns in the logfile.

split_log.py:

This script takes a logfile and splits it into multiple logfile, one for each locality. It also orders the events in each by its "count".
