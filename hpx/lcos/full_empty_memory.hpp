    /// The \a full_empty data type is a implementation of memory areas guarded
    /// by full/empty bits, a very low level synchronization primitive. The 
    /// class has been modeled after the FEB implementation in the QThread
    /// library (see here: http://www.cs.sandia.gov/qthreads/).
    ///
    /// All member functions but \a set_empty and \a set_full have the potential 
    /// of blocking until the corresponding precondition is met. Memory is 
    /// assumed to be full unless otherwise asserted, and as such memory that 
    /// is full and does not have dependencies (i.e. no threads are waiting for 
    /// it to become empty) does not require state data to be stored. It is 
    /// expected that while there may be locks instantiated at one time or 
    /// another for a very large number of addresses in the system, relatively 
    /// few will be in a non-default (full, no waiters) state at any one time.
    ///
    /// The main idea is, that a memory location can be either empty or full.
    /// setting or writing a value to a location sets it to full. Reading from 
    /// a location retrieves the value and (optionally) sets it to empty. A 
    /// write will block if the location is full and will wait for it to become
    /// empty. If several write's are waiting for a location to become empty 
    /// only one thread will be re-activated the moment it gets empty. A read 
    /// will block if the location is empty and will wait for it to become
    /// full. If several read's are waiting for a location to become full 
    /// all threads will be re-activated the moment it gets full. 
    /// 
    /// full_empty memory locations are very useful for synchronization and 
    /// data delivery (especially in producer/consumer scenarios).

    /// \tparam  T  The template parameter defines the type of the memory 
    ///             location to be guarded by an empty/full bit. It is possible
