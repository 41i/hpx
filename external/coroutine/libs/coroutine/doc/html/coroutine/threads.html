<p>
        Boost.Coroutine provides a restricted version of the distinct objects thread
        safety guarantee. The library is thread safe as long as these preconditions
        are valid:
      </p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li>
          All member functions of a coroutine can only be called from the owning
          thread (the thread where a coroutine has been created is said to be the
          owning thread; creating a coroutine means invoking any constructor).
        </li>
<li>
          Distinct coroutine instances can be freely called from different threads.
        </li>
</ol></div>
<p>
        It follows from 1 that:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
          A coroutine instance cannot be called from any thread other than the one
          where it has been created.
        </li>
<li>
          A coroutine instance cannot yield to any other coroutine instance unless
          the latter has been created in the same thread of the former.
        </li>
</ul></div>
<a name="threads.what_does_this_means_in_practice"></a><h3>
<a name="id703775"></a>
        What does this means in practice
      </h3>
<p>
        In practice a coroutine cannot migrate from one thread to another. For its
        whole lifetime it is bound to one specific thread. Other threads cannot safely
        access any coroutine member functions.
      </p>
<div class="sidebar"><p>
        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/caution.png" alt="caution"></span> Not even locking can be safely used to protect concurrent
        accesses to a coroutine. That is two treads cannot invoke the same coroutine
        even if the serialize access through a mutex.
      </p></div>
<p>
        If coroutines are, for example, used to implement a M on N threading models
        (M coroutines on N threads with <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">N</span>
        <span class="special">&lt;</span> <span class="identifier">M</span></tt>),
        coroutines cannot be dynamically migrated from a more loaded thread to a
        less loaded threads.
      </p>
<a name="threads.threads_and_boost_asio"></a><h3>
<a name="id703830"></a>
        Threads and Boost.Asio
      </h3>
<p>
        From the threads guarantees of Boost.Coroutine, it follows that, if coroutines
        are ever inserted in an <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">asio</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">io_service</span></tt>,
        no more than one thread can call <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">io_service</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">run</span><span class="special">()</span></tt>.
        This thread must be the one that created all coroutines inserted in the
        <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">io_service</span></tt>.
      </p>
<p>
        This means that the "one <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">io_service</span></tt>
        per thread" scheme must be used.
      </p>
<div class="sidebar"><p>
        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/note.png" alt="note"></span> This means that on Windows platforms an application
        cannot take advantage of the ability of a <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Win32</span></tt>
        completion port to balance the load across all threads bound to it. This
        might incur, in some applications, in a performance penalty. On the other
        hand the thread affinity of coroutines might result in better CPU affinity
        and thus a better cache utilization and memory usage especially on <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">NUMA</span> <span class="identifier">SMP</span></tt>
        systems.
      </p></div>
<a name="threads.relaxing_requirements"></a><h3>
<a name="id705188"></a>
        Relaxing requirements
      </h3>
<p>
        In the future, as more experience with the library is gained, the thread
        safety restrictions could be slightly relaxed. It is likely that the owning
        thread will become the first one to invoke <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="keyword">operator</span><span class="special">()</span></tt> for that coroutine or <tt class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">yield_to</span></tt>
        that coroutine.
      </p>
<p>
        It is unlikely that thread migration will ever be possible (nor it is believed
        to be a necessary feature).
      </p>

        For a rationale for the current requirements see <a href="coroutine_thread.html" title=" Interaction between coroutines and threads">"Interaction
        between coroutines and threads"</a>.
