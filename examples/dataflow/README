This simple example illustrates a dataflow component called unigrid_mesh which creates 
two rows of three stencils set up
to immitate a simple unigrid mesh finite difference or finite element simulation.  Each stencil
has three inputs and three output; remote stencil access has been serialized so that only the
boundary values of the stencils are actually sent as parcels (just like you would do in a typically
MPI simulation).     

The initial data is random and the right hand side computation is a simple copy in order to make
the example simpler.
