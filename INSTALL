HPX Installation QuickStart:
============================

Please make sure you have the following packages installed BEFORE 
compiling HPX: 
    1) CMake Ver. 2.6.2 URL: http://www.cmake.org
    2) Boost C++ Libraries (at least V1.35) URL: http://www.boost.org

Installation Instructions:
==========================
Download the latest Subversion release of HPX sourcecode from:
    https://svn.cct.lsu.edu/repos/projects/parallex/trunk/hpx
    
Export the BOOST_ROOT environment to point to your BOOST installation 
directory:
    [bash]$ export BOOST_ROOT=<path_to_your_boost_installation>>
    [csh] % setenv BOOST_ROOT <path_to_your_boost_installation>
    
In your HPX_ROOT directory generate makefiles using "cmake":
    $ cmake .

This will generate Makefile's allowing to build and install HPX. The default 
installation directory is /usr/lib. To change the installation target directory
invoke cmake as:

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX=<your directory here> .

Compile the HPX sourcecode and example using "make":
    $ make

The compilation messages should provide information on progress rate
and the success of compilation & linking of HPX code. 

Install the HPX binaries and header files:
    $ make install

If you have difficulty in compiling the code, please email 
the HPX developers at:

   gopx@cct.lsu.edu


Known Issues
************
On some Unix Systems, CMake 2.6 fails to locate the installed BOOST 
library instance. One of the known issues that causes the failure to locate 
the libraries is due to regular expression issues in FindBoost.cmake module of 
the default CMake install. 

In HPX_ROOT/misc/ please find a modified FindBoost.cmake that helps resolve this 
problem and a description on how install the module.
